    description: >-
        *  Significantly optimized the SmartCarne system by integrating critical perception algorithms: MixFormer for enhanced real-time payload tracking and improved cargo management; BEVFusion for improved 3D object detection, enhancing navigation in complex environments; SemAttNet for depth completion, enhancing spatial understanding for precise maneuvering; and YOLOv8 for improved object detection, strengthening situational awareness and decision-making. These collective refinements significantly increased the system's operational efficiency and reliability.

        *  Led the design and development of the RobotGPT platform using V-REP, leveraging a visual language model (LLAVA), a policy agent based on Perceiver-Actor, and a unique vision-language representation. This integrated approach significantly improved 3D scene perception, strategic task planning, robotic decision-making, and human-robot interaction, leading to a 35% overall increase in robotics operations success rate.
