title: "3D-Aware Human Texture Synthesis"
summary: "This project presents a generative model capable of producing realistic textures for 3D human body meshes. The model, built on StyleGAN2, was trained using the SURREAL and AGORA datasets, and renders photorealistic images given a variety of poses and camera angles. \n

The project is awarded as the **best project** of the [course](https://learning-image-synthesis.github.io/sp22/)."
