I'm a Master's student in robotics at Carnegie Mellon University under Professor Fernando la Torre and Dr. Dong Huang at the DeLight Lab. My long-term research goal is to improve the way artificial intelligent agents perceive, interpret and understand the world.

My current research interests focus on **1) 3D Vision**: The ability to infer, model, and utilize 3D representations is of significant importance in AI, with applications ranging from robotic manipulation and self-driving to virtual reality. Currently I'm working on the project about reconstructing full-range human meshes through monocular camera; **2) Multimodal Machine Learning**: Recent researches prove that AI agents benefit from multimodal learning especially for complicated tasks. Dr. Dong and I are recently developing the alogrithm to directly transfer representation and knowledge between modalities (from Lidar, WiFi, and infrared to RGB images). 

I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges, so don't be afraid to contact me :)
