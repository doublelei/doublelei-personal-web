Welcome to my personal website. I'm currently a Research Engineer Intern at Baidu USA, after receiving my Master's degree in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, where I had the distinct honor of working under the guidance of Prof. Fernando la Torre and Dr. Dong Huang at the DeLight Lab.

My mission is to enhance the capabilities of artificial intelligent agents in perceiving, interpreting, and interacting with the world. To accomplish this, my work centers around three key areas:

**3D Vision**: I believe in the transformational power of 3D representations in AI, with applications spanning robotic manipulation, autonomous driving, and virtual reality. 

**Multimodal Machine Learning**: My research has led me to the conclusion that AI agents can achieve significantly improved results by harnessing the power of multimodal learning, especially for intricate tasks. I had the privilege of collaborating with Dr. Dong on developing an algorithm that directly transfers representation and knowledge across diverse modalities, including Lidar, WiFi, infrared, and RGB images.

**Embodied AI**: I have a deep fascination for Embodied AI, and the potential it holds for revolutionizing various industries and aspects of everyday life. At Baidu, I led the design and development of the RobotGPT platform.

I'm always keen to embrace new opportunities in AI and Robotics. If you have a challenging project or want to discuss the future of AI and Robotics, feel free to reach out. I'd love to connect!
