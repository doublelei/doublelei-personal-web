I'm a Research Engineer Intern at Baidu USA, with a Master's in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University. Under Prof. Fernando la Torre and Dr. Dong Huang at the DeLight Lab, I focused on enhancing AI's ability to understand and interact with the world. My work emphasizes 3D Vision, Multimodal Machine Learning, and Embodied AI. At Baidu, I led the RobotGPT platform development. I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI and Robotics and welcome discussions on future challenges and opportunities in the field.
