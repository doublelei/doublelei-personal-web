abstract: "Personal handwriting style fonts generation is a diverting but time-consuming task due to the large size of Chinese character set. In addition, unlike standard printed style fonts, hand-writing style fonts are of more complicated stroke and glyph feature. In this paper, an improved network architecture is proposed for learning and generation of personal hand-writing style fonts based on small character set. The network is composed of three sub-networks: 1) a classification network for identifying the general style of the target fonts; 2) a generating network for transferring the identified fonts to the target fonts; 3) a discriminating network for differentiating the generated image from real ones. The experiments revealed the effectiveness of the model for generating personal hand-writing style font with relatively small data size, reduction by a scale of 10 comparing to previous reported works."
